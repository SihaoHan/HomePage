summary: Machine learning-based optimization of dual-functional acoustic black hole metamaterial.
abstract: 'In the research of engineering structures and materials, the pursuit of shock resistance, high load bearing, broadband vibration isolation is an eternal topic. In this study, a bi-functional acoustic black hole metamaterial plate is optimized based on machine learning, which simultaneously achieves excellent elastic wave attenuation performance and high load carrying capacity. By combining acoustic black hole effect, nano-composite reinforcement material and viscoelastic damping effect, the acoustic black hole superplate has dual functions of high stiffness and high elastic wave attenuation. Firstly, based on a semi-analytical method combining first-order shear plate theory and Bloch-Floquet theorem, the band structure of the proposed metamaterial plate is calculated, and the effects of acoustic black hole effect, nano-composite reinforcement material and viscoelastic damping layer on the bending wave band gap or in-plane stiffness are analyzed respectively. Then, a deep learning proxy model is used to establish the relationship between the topology structure and material parameters and the two optimization objectives representing the band-gap characteristics and in-plane stiffness. The performance evaluation of the proxy model proves its accuracy and high efficiency. Finally, an optimization strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to obtain a dual-function superplate with superior bandgap, high in-plane stiffness, or both. The robustness and effectiveness of this optimization strategy are verified by different tests. The results show that this strategy can achieve the same accuracy as the existing optimization algorithms, but it is superior to the existing algorithms in terms of computational efficiency and multi-objective balance. The results of this study have important reference value for the development and application of multi-functional advanced metamaterials for practical engineering applications in the future.'
