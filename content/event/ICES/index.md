summary: Machine learning-aided customization on mechanical response and wave attenuation of multifunctional origami metamaterial.
abstract: 'Multifunctional metamaterials attract extensive attention for simultaneously satisfying diverse engineering applications, such as protection against mechanical and vibratory intrusions. Here, the impact resistance and wave characteristics of multi-functional metamaterials based on the kresling origami are optimized and inversely designed. The elegant kresling origami metamaterials offer excellent energy absorption and broadband vibration isolations. The incomparable compression-twist of kresling origamis promote impact resistance and efficient elastic wave attenuation, providing comprehensive protection for crushing and vibration. With the help of a machine learning-aided framework, optimization and inverse design are achieved. The machine learning-aided framework enables rapid prediction and optimization. Experiments and numerical simulations confirm the reliability and superiority. This work holds significant potential for the development and application of multi-functional, multi-physical field and multi-scale metamaterials.'
