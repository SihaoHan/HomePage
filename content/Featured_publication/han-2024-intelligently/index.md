abstract: Engineering applications concurrently face challenges related to vibration, impact, load-bearing and energy absorption. Here, an arch-honeycomb metamaterial with split-ring resonators is proposed for wave attenuation and impact mitigation, with better energy absorption and lower initial peak stress. The split-ring resonators effectively induce bandgaps below 3 kHz, and the mechanisms of bandgap generation and polarization are studied through mode shapes, frequency contours and equivalent mass densities. Subsequently, a machine learning-based optimization framework is introduced to tailor the bandgaps, leading to a 155.59% increase in bandgap width. Furthermore, superior vibration isolation and impact mitigation are confirmed through experiments. Obvious attenuation peaks are observed in the bandgaps of the acceleration transmission spectrum in frequency domain. In time domain, the impact test demonstrates peak weakening and delay. The metamaterials offer advantages in wave attenuation, impact mitigation, load-bearing and energy absorption, providing valuable insights for the advancement of multifunctional metamaterials and their practical engineering applications.
