abstract: Local resonant metamaterials show significant promise in applications involving the attenuation of impact waves. This paper introduces a honeycomb metamaterial featuring a circular distribution of multiple mass-beam resonators designed to enhance impact mitigation by broadening low frequency bandgaps. The bandgaps of unit cells with different number of mass-beam resonators (MBR) are calculated. It is found that the unit cell with circularly distributed resonators (C-MBR) has strong low frequency local resonance in all directions, thus opening a complete wide bandgap in about 500â€“1200Hz. Then, a method of equivalent stiffness reduction related to the corresponding mode shapes is used to research the negative effective mass density characteristic, explaining the generation of the low frequency bandgaps. Subsequently, the impact protection capacity of local resonant metamaterial is compared with that of ordinary honeycomb metamaterial through experiment and simulation. Interestingly, the maximum acceleration values under the impact load of local resonant metamaterial are about 45% lower than that of honeycomb metamaterial, and the reaction force under the blast load is about 80% reduction. Besides, by analyzing the acceleration curve waveform and transmission spectrum, the local resonant metamaterial is found to exhibit continuous short period vibration, which blocks the wave in low frequency band. Finally, the energy dissipation performance of the local resonant metamaterial explains that it converts more impact energy into the kinetic energy of the core with resonators, thereby reducing the energy transferred to the bottom panel. These results underscore the potential application of the proposed metamaterial with multi-resonators in impact mitigation and energy dissipation.
