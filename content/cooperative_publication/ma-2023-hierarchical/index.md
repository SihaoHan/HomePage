abstract: A novel hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb metamaterial is proposed by integrating the re-entrant honeycomb (RH) with square unit cell and named as square re-entrant honeycomb (SRH). The novel hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb can not only improve energy absorption capacity but also present better vibration insulation compared with traditional RH structure. Dynamic crushing behaviors of the SRH structures are investigated theoretically and numerically. The theoretical plateau stress is in good agreement with the numerical plateau stress. Meanwhile, the deformation modes and energy absorption capacity of RH and square re-entrant honeycombs (SRHs) are compared under different impact velocities. The results show that the plateau stress and the specific energy absorption (SEA) of SRHs is higher than RH. Moreover, the vibration isolation capability of the SRHs is studied using finite element analysis. In particular, the introduction of square unit cells expand the band gap, especially in the low frequency range. By adjusting the size of oscillators, the starting and stopping frequencies of band gaps are lower effectively and the number of band gaps is increased. The results indicate that the introduction of the mass inclusions can improve the band gap characteristics of the SRH, which produce local resonance effect and the local resonance type band gap. It also appears multiple band gaps at the same time. In addition, the introduction of the mass inclusions also improves the SEA of the SRH under high-velocity crushing. This work may benefit structural vibration isolation and protection design, which provides a new thought for design and development of advanced multi-functional composite structures and materials in the engineering.
