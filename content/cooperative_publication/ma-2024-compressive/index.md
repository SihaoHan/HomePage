abstract: Metastructures have drawn extensive attention from researchers due to their excellent mechanical properties. In this paper, to further enhance the mechanical properties of the re-entrant origami honeycomb metastructure, the bio-inspired hierarchical design is introduced on the re-entrant origami honeycomb metastructure, a novel hierarchical re-entrant origami honeycomb (HROH) metastructure is proposed. The crashworthiness of the novel HROH is researched under low-velocity and high-velocity impact. The results indicate a significant improvement in the energy absorption capacity of the novel HROH compared to both the conventional hierarchical re-entrant honeycomb and the re-entrant origami honeycomb. The plateau stress of the novel HROH under different compression velocities are derived by the two-scale method. And the theoretical results are in good agreement with the numerical results. Moreover, the influences of the dihedral angles and wall thickness on impact resistance also are studied. To increase the wall thickness will improve the plateau stress and SEA–strain curve of the HROH, while increasing the dihedral angles will diminish the plateau stress and SEA–strain curve. In addition, to obtain the optimal structure of the HROH, a multi-objective optimization method based on surrogate models and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed. The results exhibit high accuracy in the crashworthiness optimization. This study provides a crucial reference for the design and application of buffer protection structure in fields such as automotive, aerospace and defense.
