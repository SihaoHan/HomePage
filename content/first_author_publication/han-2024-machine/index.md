abstract: This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based optimization strategy for multi-functional acoustic black hole (ABH) metaplates. The primary objective is to achieve a multi-functional metaplate with excellent performance in elastic wave attenuation and load-bearing capacity simultaneously. The paper begins by describing the design of nanocomposite ABH metaplates, presenting a new pathway to realize multi-functional metaplates. Then, a semi-analytical method, based on plate theory and the Blochâ€“Floquet theorem, is introduced to consider the band structure of the nanocomposite metaplates. Through systematic analysis, the impacts of the ABH effect, nanocomposite reinforcements, and the viscoelastic damping layer on the bandgaps and strain energy compliance are highlighted. Meanwhile, two optimization objectives representing bandgap characteristics and in-plane stiffness are derived respectively. Subsequently, a deep learning surrogate model is employed to establish a relationship involving significant parameters with the optimization objectives. The performance evaluation confirms accuracy and computational speed of the surrogate model. Finally, an optimization strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to obtain multi-functional metaplates with superior bandgaps, enhanced in-plane stiffness, or both. The robustness and efficiency of the strategy are demonstrated under different tests. The results show that the proposed strategy can achieve identical results as the genetic algorithm and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, while surpassing them in computational efficiency and balancing multiple objectives. The findings of this study serve as valuable references for the future development and application of multi-functional advanced metamaterials.
