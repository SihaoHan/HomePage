abstract: Topological metamaterial possesses a unique ability to govern elastic wave propagation within mechanical systems, facilitating low-loss transmission and precise directional control. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the mechanical robustness of topological metamaterials. Here, an elegant multifunctional sandwich origami-based topological metamaterial is proposed and customized by a machine learning-based approach. By emulating quantum valley Hall effect and breaking the space-inversion symmetry, topological states and topologically protected wave transport are achieved. Topological features exhibit significant impact on deformation stability and mechanical robustness under compressive loads, enabling programmable mechanical behaviors. Obvious local resonances are generated in the origami cores, leading to significant wave attenuation and effective vibration isolation. Moreover, comprehensive customization, including optimization and inverse design of topological wave characteristics and mechanical responses are achieved through the integration of deep learning prediction and reinforcement learning optimization. The methodology controls the muiltifunctionality simultaneously, with the potential for broader applications in addressing more diverse challenges. This metamaterial enables controllable topological wave propagation with mechanical robustness, presenting significant potential for the advancement and application of elastic topological insulators.
