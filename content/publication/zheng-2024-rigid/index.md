abstract: Mechanical metamaterials with multistable unit cells featured by negative stiffness or quasi-zero stiffness is attracting increasing attention owing to their unique mechanical properties and reusable potential. In this paper, a hierarchical-bistable hybrid metamaterial with rigidâ€“flexible coupling design is proposed, demonstrating excellent mitigation performance and protection against multiple impacts. The metamaterial consists of a multi-layer bistable beams with a central honeycomb and is manufactured by 3D printing. Firstly, the negative stiffness characteristics of the curved beams in the metamaterial are theoretically determined, and the convergence of the finite element model under different mesh sizes is analyzed. And the quasi-zero stiffness characteristics of the metamaterial have been confirmed, along with its more stable and uniform deformation pattern, through the quasi-static compression experiment. Then the buffering performance of the metamaterial is studied in ball impact tests, showing an average improvement of about 65% compared to the rigid control group, while verifying the accuracy of the finite element model. With the analysis of the deformation modes and strain energy, the mitigation mechanism of metamaterials is demonstrated to extend the contact time and disperse the impact load through the layered deformation to reduce the peak response, instead of relying on plastic strain. Finally, the reusability of the metamaterial is explored by the ten-times plate impacts simulation. The results demonstrate that the metamaterial decreases the plastic strain of its structure by 60% while reducing impact response, thereby preventing the premature failure of core components. These results demonstrate the great potential of the proposed metamaterials for various engineering applications, including aircraft or spacecraft landing protection, vehicle pedestrian protection, and the transportation protection of fragile objects or precision instruments.
