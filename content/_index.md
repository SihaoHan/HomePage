      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on the wave characteristics and impact behavior of elastic and mechanical metamaterials, with a particular interest in multifunctional metamaterials. I am using advanced numerical simulation and machine learning to enable multi-performance prediction, optimization, and on-demand customization of advanced materials and structures, in an attempt to push the frontier of combining artificial intelligence and solid mechanics. The architected structures I have studied include honeycombs, kiri/origamis, pixelated topologies, and acoustic black holes. To date, I have published eight journal papers as the (co-)first author, with an additional two currently under review.

        I am a student in a successive postgraduate and doctoral program, and expect to receive my PhD in the summer, 2027. I have earned my bachelor's degree from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2021. My PhD thesis is **_Mechanics- and machine learning-driven customization of multifunctional metamaterials_**. Supervised by [Prof Qiang Han](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/jtxy/2023/0430/c35044a500284/page.htm) and [A/Prof Chunlei Li](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/jtxy/2023/0430/c35045a500283/page.htm). 

        This webpage is still under construction, there are many features are not complete. Thanks to HUGO for the open source template.
